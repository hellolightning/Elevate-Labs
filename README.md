# Basic Vulnerabilty Scan on Local network

## 🎯 Objectives

 . Perform a comprehensive vulnerability scan on a local system
 
 . Identify and analyze security vulnerabilities using industry-standard tools
 
 . Document findings and provide actionable remediation strategies
 
 . Demonstrate practical cybersecurity assessment skills and Gain hands-on experience in identifying vulnerabilities using OpenVAS or Nessus Essentials.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

Tenable Nessus Essentials: Primary vulnerability scanner

Kali Linux: Target system for vulnerability assessment

## Steps

### Phase 1: Environment Setup

Installed Nessus Essentials on assessment system

Configured scan target (192.168.x.x - Kali Linux)

Verified network connectivity and service accessibility


### Phase 2: Vulnerability Scanning

Executed comprehensive vulnerability scan using Nessus

Targeted localhost/local machine IP address

Performed full system assessment (30-60 minute duration)

Generated detailed vulnerability report


### Phase 3: Analysis and Documentation

Analyzed scan results for critical vulnerabilities

Categorized findings by severity level

Researched remediation strategies

Documented comprehensive assessment report

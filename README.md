# 🛡️ Password Strength Evaluation & Security Best Practices

## Objective:

The goal of this task is to explore the effectiveness of different password strengths, learn password creation best practices, understand how common attacks exploit weak passwords, and summarize how password complexity impacts security.

## Steps Performed 

1. Created multiple passwords with varying complexity.
   Used uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols, and length variations.

| Password Sample | Type |
| --- | --- |
| password123 | 🔴 Very Weak |
| WhoAmI23 | 🟠 Weak |
| Why#Pass01 | 🟡 Medium |
| Why@Typepass&1 | 🟢 Strong |
| Boogie&Woggie#01 | 🟢 Very Strong |


2. Test each password on password strength checker.

   [Bitwarden Strength Tester](https://bitwarden.com/password-strength/)
   
3. Results & Feedback

| Password Sample | Estimated Crack Time | Tool Feedback|
| --- | --- | --- |
| password123 | Few seconds or <1 second | Very Weak |
| WhoAmI23 | Few Minutes | Weak |
| Why#Pass01 | Few Hours to Week | Medium |
| Why@Typepass&0 | Months to Years | Strong |
| Boogie&Woggie#01 | 1 million years | Very Strong |

## Best Practices for Strong and Secured Passwords



## Password Security Tips & Insights

. Avoid using the same password everywhere.
. Never use personal info (name, birthday, etc.)
. Include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
. Avoid using dictionary words or predictable sequences
. Use a password manager it encrypts your passwords and credentials and help you organize them securely.
. MFA/2FA is essential for all important accounts.

## Common Password Attacks & Defenses

| Attack Type	| Description |	Defense |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Brute Force |	Tries all possible combinations	| Long, complex passwords |
| Dictionary Attack |	Uses common words/phrases |	Avoid dictionary words & common substitutions |
| Credential Stuffing |	Uses leaked password pairs | Unique passwords for every account |
| Keylogger	| Captures keystrokes |	Use security software, avoid suspicious links |
| Rainbow Table |	Precomputed hash tables	| Use strong, salted hashes (for admins) |
